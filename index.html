    <h1>Dental Emergencies Guide</h1>
    <p>We've all experienced some sort of dental pain or discomfort at one point or another. But how can you determine if your situation constitutes a dental emergency requiring urgent care? Knowing what circumstances warrant emergency attention along with your options for treatment can help provide relief and prevent complications when dental issues arise.</p>

    <h2><b>Common Dental Emergencies</b></h2>
    <p>There are various types of dental emergencies that indicate the need for prompt treatment or intervention. Some examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Toothaches:</b> Extreme, throbbing tooth pain often signals infection or other problems requiring immediate care. Severe sensitivity to hot or cold temperatures also means it's time to call your dentist.</li>
        <li><b>Lost or broken fillings:</b> If an existing filling falls out, breaks, or becomes cracked and irritates your tongue, the exposed tooth area is at risk for additional decay. Applying dental wax can temporarily reduce discomfort.</li>
        <li><b>Broken or chipped teeth:</b> Visible damage exposing the tooth's inner layers puts you at higher risk for infection. It's important to get fractured pieces repaired quickly before the situation worsens.</li>
        <li><b>Knocked out teeth:</b> When teeth are completely knocked from their sockets, emergency dental care within 30 minutes to 1 hour gives you the best chance to have it successfully reimplanted. In the meantime, proper tooth storage and handling are key.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>Signs that Indicate You Need Emergency Dental Care</b></h2>
    <p>How do you know if you should seek emergency help versus waiting for a routine dental appointment? Signs requiring urgent care include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Severe tooth or gum pain</b></li>
        <li><b>Prolonged bleeding from the mouth</b></li>
        <li><b>Painful swelling in the mouth, jaw, or gums</b></li>
        <li><b>Facial bruising or injury</b></li>
        <li><b>Numbness or tingling around the mouth</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If experiencing any of these worrisome symptoms along with oral health issues, emergency assistance may be warranted.</p>

    <h2><b>What to Do for a Toothache</b></h2>
    <p>Toothaches can definitely make you drop everything and desperately seek relief! Here is what to do while you wait for an emergency dental appointment.</p>

        <li><b>Make an emergency dental appointment:</b> The only way to definitively diagnose and properly treat a toothache is scheduling an urgent dental visit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>Options for a Broken or Lost Filling</b></h2>
    <p>It can be alarming to have an existing silver-colored filling suddenly fall out while eating, leaving a gaping hole in your tooth enamel. Here is what to do next.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Use dental wax as a temporary fix:</b> After thoroughly rinsing your mouth, cover the exposed tooth area by gently pressing a small ball of dental wax over it.</li>
        <li><b>Make an emergency dental appointment:</b> While wax temporarily plugs the open space, contacting your <a href="https://www.dentee.com/dentists/delhi" target="_blank">dentist in Delhi</a> promptly for an emergency visit is critical.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>Treating Broken or Chipped Teeth</b></h2>
    <p>Cracked, fractured, or chipped teeth constitute dental emergencies demanding prompt care. Here is what you need to know for next steps.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Save any broken fragments:</b> Gently rinse out your mouth while carefully safeguarding all tooth pieces. Bring these to your dentist, as they may be usable for repairs.</li>
        <li><b>Use dental wax:</b> Applying wax over a chipped tooth's rough edges provides protective buffering and reduces irritation against your tongue until undergoing dental treatment.</li>
        <li><b>Get emergency dental care:</b> Schedule emergency dentistry as soon as possible after tooth damage occurs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>What to Do for a Knocked Out Tooth</b></h2>
    <p>Having a tooth completely knocked from its socket is a serious situation demanding emergency dental expertise. Taking quick action aids chances for tooth replanting.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Use milk, saline, or holding solution to preserve tooth:</b> After a tooth gets knocked out, carefully handle it by the crown onlyâ€”avoid touching fragile root structures. Gently rinse off in water if dirty but do not scrub.</li>
        <li><b>Gently reinsert tooth in socket:</b> While en route to your dentist, try lightly reinserting the tooth into its original socket if possible.</li>
        <li><b>Get emergency dental care within 30 minutes to 1 hour:</b> See a dentist ASAP!</li>
    </ul>
